# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  April 1, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Updated the Authentication class of the NAP-PHP.

**Thoughts:** Months have passed since I touched this boilerplate. It's really funny how I forget how this simple thing works, even though I'm the one who wrote it.

### Day 2:  April 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Updated the Validation class of the NAP-PHP.

**Thoughts:** I want to add more checks, but I think this is enough as of now. A lot of "dreamy" functionality can stall progress.

### Day 4:  April 4, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Build the page that will act as the 3vil site for testing.

**Thoughts:** The user should set the configuration depending on the target 3vil site.

### Day 5:  April 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Created the sink dashboard.

**Thoughts:** The basic interface is done, and experience does really help a lot in debugging. There's a flash, "ah! ok" that solves the specific bug. Grinding is worth it.
