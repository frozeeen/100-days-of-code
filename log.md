# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  April 1, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Updated the Authentication class of the NAP-PHP.

**Thoughts:** Months have passed since I touched this boilerplate. It's really funny how I forget how this simple thing works, even though I'm the one who wrote it.

### Day 2:  April 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Updated the Validation class of the NAP-PHP.

**Thoughts:** I want to add more checks, but I think this is enough as of now. A lot of "dreamy" functionality can stall progress..
